# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 4, 2026**

## Overview

Prism ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### 1. Google Account Information
When you sign in with Google, we receive:
- Your email address (for authentication only)
- Your name (for display purposes)
- Access to Google Sheets you explicitly authorize

**We do NOT store your Google password.** Authentication is handled securely through Google's OAuth 2.0.

### 2. Financial Data
- Transaction data you import from Google Sheets
- Transactions you manually enter in the app
- Categories and budgets you create

**Important:** Your financial data is stored locally on your device. We do not upload, transmit, or store your financial data on any external servers.

### 3. Google Sheets Access
We request access to:
- **Read** your Google Sheets (to import transactions)
- **Write** to your Google Sheets (to sync new transactions)

We only access spreadsheets you explicitly select. We never access other files in your Google Drive.

## How We Use Your Information

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Email address | Authenticate your identity |
| Google Sheets access | Import and sync your budget data |
| Transaction data | Display reports and analytics in the app |

## Data Storage

- **Local storage only**: All your financial data is stored on your device
- **No cloud sync**: We do not have servers that store your data
- **Token storage**: Google authentication tokens are stored securely on your device

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties.**

The only external service we connect to is Google (for authentication and Sheets access), which is governed by [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).

## Your Rights

You can:
- **Revoke access** to Google Sheets at any time via [Google Account Permissions](https://myaccount.google.com/permissions)
- **Delete all data** from the app using the "Clear Data" option in Settings
- **Disconnect** your Google account from the app at any time

## Security

We implement industry-standard security measures:
- OAuth 2.0 for secure Google authentication
- Secure token storage using device encryption
- No transmission of financial data to external servers

## Children's Privacy

This app is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. We will notify you of any changes by updating the "Last updated" date.
